Hit the Bennies Mobile Application By: Jeniffer Jimenez, Cole Ledford, John Mullis, and Christian Rodriguez

HittheBennies is an Android mobile application, inspired by whack a mole game, that displays squirrels for the player to hit to increase their score within the given time restraints. There are three time levels: easy (30 sec), medium (15 sec), and hard (10 sec).
Once you select your prefered difficulty, the desired time will start once the play button is pressed. Once you start hitting the Bennies, they will appear and disappear depending on which button you press. 

This Application was created using the Android Studio IDE, and development using Java13.0. To download this application, click on the code button, scroll down to download into zip file, and open the extracted folder in android studio.
